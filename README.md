# shieldInsights

  SHIELD https://www.shieldcollaborative.org is a cooperative of charitable organisations working to coordinate efforts to match PPE supply and demand in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak. EWveryone working for and with SHIELD and these charities is a volunteer. 
  
### Insights

The insights team is here to answer fundamental questions, allowing the charities to make the maximum impact by understanding where the current and future supply shortages are likely to be.
- Where is the current demand for PPE? Healthcare setting / location / PPE items?
- How has demand for PPE changed over the course of the pandemic, and where is it heading?
- How has / is supply changing, and therefore, where are the likely shortfalls?
  
This is a repo to collate shared output and data sources relating to our work into PPE supply and insights.
